# News_API
## This project is a part of Xsolla summer school entry test.

In this very basic API you can work with:
- Article - simple model with title, tag and array of users, who liked it.
- Tag - just made for filtering purposes.
- User - just here to add like and remove it.
- Like - simple article and user pair.

What can you do with it?
1. Article
  - Get all articles in storage with filters and sort options
  - Get article by id
  - Post article
2. Tag
  - Get all tags in storage
  - Get tag by id
  - Post tag
3. User
  - Get all users
4. Like
  - Get all likes in storage
  - Get like by id
  - Post like
  - Delete like by id
5. View swagger docs at /docs

Things to know about:
  - There are *some* tests in main_test.go that cover required features
  - In all models there are presets for tests
  - Open API is generated with swagger package https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger using:
  ```
    swagger generate spec -o ./swagger.yaml --scan-models
  ```
  - Published Open API specification on swaggerhub at https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Wardenclock1759/of-news_api/1.0.0
  - Docker image: https://hub.docker.com/r/wardenclock/news-api-docker/tags
  ```
  docker pull wardenclock/news-api-docker:v1
  ```
  - To operate docker-compose.yml you should do the following:
  ```
  docker-compose up -d
  docker-compose run -d -p 8000:5000 news-api-service
  ```
  - All works on localhost:8000/ at least for me. And don't forget to turn it off by typing ```docker-compose down```
